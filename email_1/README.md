This is a random email template I found.

I recreated it however the original designer didn't really seem to consider how it would work on phones or Outlook
The areas where the images switch right and left is a coll concept but when put on phones it makes the images smaller thus adding lots of white space to the page.
I would either have all the images on one side so on the phone it can be made single column. Or eliminate much of the text do that the checkerboard effect can be kept. 

The original mock also relied on CSS height, width, and positioning. Almost all pf this breaks in Outlook. In the case for phones it also doesn't make sense to have a user download a image bigger than they need.
